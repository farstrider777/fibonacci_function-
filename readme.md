###Wrote a recursive function to determine the value of any given number on the Fibonacci sequence###

Skills practiced

1. Javascript
  * Wrote and tested a recursive function.
  * Followed and modified data flow through a recursive function.
  * Rewrote my recursive function to be a linear recursive function which saves my Fibonacci sequence to an array at each step, thus reducing work on the computer and allowing it to run larger numbers quickly.
